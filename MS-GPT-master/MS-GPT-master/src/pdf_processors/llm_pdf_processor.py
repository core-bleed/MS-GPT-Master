    Extract and clean the raw text content from this PDF document following these strict rules:
    1. **Remove ALL**:
    - References/citations (e.g., [1], (Smith 2020))
    - Figure/table mentions (e.g., "Figure 1:", "Table 2 shows...")
    - Captions, footnotes, or marginalia
    - Page numbers/headers/footers
    - Stray characters, symbols, or OCR artifacts

    2. Preserve ONLY:
    - Main body text paragraphs
    - Natural paragraph breaks (single blank line between paragraphs)
    - Corrected OCR errors ONLY when absolutely certain (e.g., "teh" → "the")

    3. Formatting:
    - Single spaces between words
    - Single line breaks between paragraphs
    - No leading/trailing whitespace

    4. Absolutely DO NOT:
    - Add any commentary, explanations, or metadata
    - Summarize or rephrase content
    - Include any non-text elements
    - Create placeholder text like "[...]"

    Return ONLY the cleaned text content with no additional text from you.
